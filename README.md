# Next.js 15: Missing Return Statement Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 where a missing `return` statement in a page component leads to a confusing runtime error.  The error message itself isn't descriptive enough to pinpoint the problem immediately.

## Problem
The `pages/about.js` file is missing a `return` statement in its functional component. This omission causes the application to throw an error during runtime, but the error message isn't clear, making debugging difficult for developers unfamiliar with this edge case.

## Solution
Adding a `return` statement, even if it's just returning `null`, solves the problem.  The solution file demonstrates this fix.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`.  You will see the error.
5. Modify `pages/about.js` to include a `return` statement (as shown in `bugSolution.js`).
6. Restart the server. The error will be resolved.
